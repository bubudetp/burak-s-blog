I wanted to do this thing for a long time now and here we are!

The idea is to write short notes, now and then. Nothing too fancy, just whatever is on my mind or what happened that day.

The idea is to keep it low-effort, no pressure to writing something deep, just a note to my future-self, or anyone who cares to read.
