#### About me

I'm a software engineer at [Anansi Solutions](https://anansi-solutions.net/), where I spend a lot of time working on different projects at the same time. I joined Anansi Solutions in September 2025, a couple months after graduating from QMUL.

I spent 3 years as a computer science student at QMUL, where I learned about core CS principles with some **practical** experience. Studying in London was enriching, its diversity and energy shaped how I approach problems collaboratively and think globally.

During that time, I spent a year at Machina Labs, where I was responsible of the MachinaNewsAI module and helped create our V3 API, refine and operate its central supporting services.

#### Some thoughts

Having written software profressionally for many years now, I'm convinced that we've traded depth for speed, and that returning to books and first principles is essential to writing software that lasts. 
These days I'm especially interested in ways to improve the longevity of software and think ahead to reduce toil in operating it. I am fully convinced that type-safe languages which exposes more problems at compile time are the future.

#### More about me :) 
I live in Zurich. Before that I lived in London for over 3 years. I'm from Saint-Louis, France's best city.

My favorite movie is [The Godfather II](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071562/). My favorite game is [Resident Evil 2 Remastered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry4sQCFOt4s).

#### Technology

This site is built on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The image files are served by a number of edge locations by CloudFlare to help ensure great performance around the globe. It's deployed automatically by CI as code lands in its master branch on GitHub.
